Grind the soaked rice, coconut and salt in a blender adding water little at a time to make a smooth batter. It is important to add a little water at a time to grind the rice into a smooth batter. When you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl. Add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating.

Add one tablespoon of oil to coat the dough and knead again. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes.Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions. Preheat the iron skillet on medium heat.Roll the dough portions into balls and flatten them with the palm of your hand. Toss them in flour and roll them out into circles of approximately 3 inches in diameter. Drizzle a little ghee and spread it on the rolled dough.We need to get a triangle shape, to do so, first fold into a semi-circle, then fold the semi-circle into half again. You get a mini triangle shape. Tossing the triangle in a little flour, roll it out gently into a big triangle. Continue the same process of rolling with the remaining dough portions.With skillet on medium high heat, place one rolled out palak paratha on the skillet. After a few seconds, you will notice air pockets popping out. At this point flip the palak paratha and smear about 1/2 a teaspoon of ghee.

Add one tablespoon of oil to coat the dough and knead again. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes.Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions. Preheat the iron skillet on medium heat.Roll the dough portions into balls and flatten them with the palm of your hand. Toss them in flour and roll them out into circles of approximately 3 inches in diameter. Drizzle a little ghee and spread it on the rolled dough.We need to get a triangle shape, to do so, first fold into a semi-circle, then fold the semi-circle into half again. You get a mini triangle shape. Tossing the triangle in a little flour, roll it out gently into a big triangle. Continue the same process of rolling with the remaining dough portions.With skillet on medium high heat, place one rolled out palak paratha on the skillet. After a few seconds, you will notice air pockets popping out. At this point flip the palak paratha and smear about 1/2 a teaspoon of ghee.

Drizzle the chutneys and yogurt over it and finally top it with sev and coriander leaves.Serve the Shahi Paratha as a it is for a quick and delicious weeknight dinner.
","To begin with Shahi Paratha, first we have to make Lachha Paratha which will serve as the base and later on we proceed by adding other ingredients on top of the Laccha Paratha.For Lachha Paratha we have to combine wheat flour, maida, salt and oil. Put water slowly and knead to form smooth dough. Cover the dough and keep aside for 15 - 20 minutes.After resting the dough, divide the dough into 4 portions and make balls out of itDivide the dough into 4 portions and make balls out of it.Take a ball of dough and roll it into 6 to 7 inches diameter disc on a dusted rolling board.Apply oil liberally on the paratha disc from the edges start to fold & pleat the paratha till the end. Roll the pleated edges tightly. Join the edges.Now roll into round parathas of about 4 to 5 inches in diameter, dusting it in flour if required.Heat the tawa over medium heat and cook parathas from both sides by brushing oil on it. Keep flipping the parathas till it is brown and slightly crisp.Similarly cook all the parathas and keep it aside. Let it cool.For the toppings, first peel and mash the boiled potatoes. Put salt, turmeric and red chilli powder in it.In a pan add oil and as it gets hot add the mashed potato mixture and mix it. Turn of the heat and let the potato cool.Take gram flour in a bowl put salt and ajwain in it. Slowly add water and mix it to form a thick paste. Now the Laccha Parathas are ready to be assembled and transform to Shahi Parathas. Take paratha spread potato mixture on it with a spoon and then spread the a small portion of the gram flour batter over it.Heat oil in a non stick tawa and place the paratha with the potato side facing down. Cook until the potatoes and the gram flour mixture gets cooked and lightly browned. This would take about 2 minutes. Once done, remove from the tawa and place it in a skillet.Similarly prepare all the other three parathas. To assemble the Shahi Paratha, place each paratha on the platter with the potato side facing up. Sprinkle the chopped onion, tomato and green chilies.

You can roll them thick or thin, it is purely your preference.Preheat an iron skillet on high heat; place the rolled dough on the skillet; after about a few seconds you will notice that smalls bubbles start rising on the dough.Turn the heat to medium; flip the rolled dough over and drizzle about half teaspoon of oil around the dough.Cook with a press and turn motion with a flat spatula or a wooden press.  You will notice the bottom side begins to brown, at this point flip over again cooking in the same press and turn motion to maintain even cooking.Once both the sides are cooked and have a few brown spots, you will also notice the texture of the bread is crisp on the outside and soft inside. Continue the similar process with the other portions of the dough and serve warm.Serve the  Methi Thalipeeth Recipe (Fresh Fenugreek Leaves Flat Bread) along with Maharashtrian Green Chilli Thecha Recipe or Lahsun ki Chutney along with Gulkand Chai Recipe by the side.

The level of water is an inch above the red rice in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. The level of water will be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy.Grind the red rice into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The red rice batter is a just slightly coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and red rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.Note on fermenting the Red Rice Idli & Dosa BatterFermentation has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally in summer, the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity. But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven. Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment. If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.This process can be mastered with experience.Method For making Dosa'sThe freshly fermented batter is great for making idlis. So typically and traditionally, the first day after the rise, we made idlis at home and there after it is great for making dosas as well.For making ragi idlis do not dilute the batter with water.When making Red Rice dosas you can optionally dilute the batter with a little water to help in easy spreading.Preheat the skillet on medium heat and grease it. Pour a ladleful of batter on the preheated tawa and spread the batter in circular motion to make a thin dosa. Drizzle ghee or oil around the dosa and allow it to crisp. Once done, flip the dosa and cook on the other side for a few seconds and serve.Proceed the same way to make the Red Rice Dosa with the remaining batter.Serve the Red Rice Dosa along with a bowl of Drumstick Sambar and Tomato Onion Chutney along with a glass of vegetable juice like Beetroot and Celery Juice for breakfast.

The batter will look fluffy.Grind the red rice into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The red rice batter is a just slightly coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and red rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.Note on fermenting the Red Rice Idli & Dosa BatterFermentation has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally in summer, the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity. But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven. Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment. If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.This process can be mastered with experience.Method For making Dosa'sThe freshly fermented batter is great for making idlis. So typically and traditionally, the first day after the rise, we made idlis at home and there after it is great for making dosas as well.For making ragi idlis do not dilute the batter with water.When making Red Rice dosas you can optionally dilute the batter with a little water to help in easy spreading.Preheat the skillet on medium heat and grease it. Pour a ladleful of batter on the preheated tawa and spread the batter in circular motion to make a thin dosa. Drizzle ghee or oil around the dosa and allow it to crisp. Once done, flip the dosa and cook on the other side for a few seconds and serve.Proceed the same way to make the Red Rice Dosa with the remaining batter.Serve the Red Rice Dosa along with a bowl of Drumstick Sambar and Tomato Onion Chutney along with a glass of vegetable juice like Beetroot and Celery Juice for breakfast. ",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/red-rice-dosa-recipe,Red Matta Rice White Urad Dal Split Methi Seeds Fenugreek Seeds Salt Water Sunflower Oil Dosa

The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Hibiscus Neer Dosa away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Dosai along with Thenga Thogayal and a glass of Chickoo Banana Date Smoothie for a wholesome breakfast.

Add salt, mix well and place it in a steel vessel with enough space for it to rise as it ferments.Let it rest overnight.Place a pan on the heat and warm some oil/ghee. Add cumin seeds, pepper corns, curry leaves, finely chopped ginger, and sauté for a minute. Add asafetida and mix again. Turn off heatAdd this prepared tempering to the fermented batter and mix well.Grease idli plates with oil, pour the batter into them and place them in a steamer.Add enough water into the steamer, shut the lid and allow it to steam it for 10 to 12 minutes until the Idli is cooked.If a spoon inserted inside the idli should come out clean, and the idli should be soft and fluffy.Remove the idli from steamer and cool it for 3 minutes.
