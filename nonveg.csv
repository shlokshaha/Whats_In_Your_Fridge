","To begin making the Laal Maas Biryani Recipe, we will first make the laal maas. To make the Laal Maas - We will first make the Laal maas masala First, soak the Kashmiri red chillies in water for about 10 minutes.  Once done, heat a saucepan with water, halfway through the pan, on medium flame and bring it to a rolling boil. Once it comes to a rolling boil, reduce the flame, and add all the whole spices - kashmiri red dry chillies, cumin seeds, black cardamom, green cardamom, cinnamon stick, cloves and bay leaf. Let it boil for about 5-7 minutes and then turn off the flame. Drain the excess water and set aside. Do not discard the water.  Cool the boiled spices to room temperature and grind to a smooth paste using very little water.Transfer the Laal Maas Masala to a bowl and set aside. To marinate the mutton for the laal maas In a mixing bowl, combine the washed and cleaned mutton along with yogurt, freshly ground laal maas masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt and ginger garlic paste. Nicely massage the marinade on to the mutton pieces, cover and set aside for a minimum of 30 minutes. To make the Laal Maas Masala CurryIn a kadai heat ghee on medium flame, add the sliced onions and saute until they turn into a lovely brown colour. This will take about 10 minutes on low medium heat stirring continuously, to get an even colour. To the browned onions, now add the ginger garlic paste, and continue to cook for yet another minute. At this stage, add the marinated mutton pieces along with the marinade and give it a good stir. Add salt to taste, and about 1/2 cup of water, and allow the mutton to cook on medium-low heat for about 25 minutes or until the mutton is 85% cooked. Turn on the flame and light a piece of charcoal until burning red hot. Once its well lit, transfer the charcoal piece, into a small katori, and add 2 cloves into this same katori. Now gently place the charcoal katori in the centre of laal maas kadai, pour about 2 teaspoons of ghee over  it and immediately close the kadai with a lid. Allow the smoke to be absorbed by the laal maas. Open the lid after 3-4 minutes, remove the katori with the coal; add the garam masala and mix it properly. Set this laal maas masala curry aside. You can eat this laal maas curry along with rice or even phulka for lunch or dinner.To make the Laal maas biryani Heat a pressure cooker with ghee on medium flame, to this add the whole spices - bay leaf, kashmiri red chilli, big cardamom, small cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. Once these whole spices begin to sizzle, add the thinly sliced onions and saute until they turn into a light brown colour. Once the onions have browned, add the ginger garlic paste, green chillies and salt. Continue to cook for about a minute or two. Then add the coriander powder, turmeric powder and kashmiri red chilli powder. Stir well, now add the pre cooked laal maas, meat and gravy included and give it a good mix until well combined. Finally, add the washed and drained rice, 4 cups of water, coriander and mint leaves and give it a quick stir. Adjust the salt to suit your taste. Close the pressure cooker and pressure cook the Laal Maas Biryani for 2-3 whistles and turn off the flame. Allow the pressure to release naturally and then open the pressure cooker.  Give the Laal Maas Biryani a gentle stir taking care to keep the Biryani rice separate.Transfer the Laal Maas Biryani to a platter and serve piping hot. Serve Laal Maas Biryani Recipe along with some Lachedar Kakdi Pyaz Kachumber Recipe and Onion Raita Recipe - Pyaz Ka Raita Recipe for a complete meal.",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/laal-maas-biryani-recipe,Mutton Bone Curd Dahi Yogurt Cumin Powder Jeera Coriander Powder Dhania Ginger Garlic Paste Salt Kashmiri Dry Red Chillies Soaked Water Least Cumin Seeds Jeera Black Cardamom Badi Elaichi Cardamom Elaichi Podsseeds Cinnamon Stick Dalchini Cloves Laung Bay Leaf Patta Ghee Onions Thinly Teaspoon Garam Masala Powder Salt Sprig Coriander Dhania Leaves Charcoal Smoking Ghee Bay Leaf Patta Kashmiri Dry Red Chillies Black Cardamom Badi Elaichi Cardamom Elaichi Podsseeds Cinnamon Stick Dalchini Cloves Laung Onions Thinly Ginger Paste Garlic Paste Salt Green Chillies Teaspoons Coriander Dhania Powder Tablespoons Kashmiri Red Chilli Powder Teaspoon Turmeric Powder Haldi Basmati Rice Soaked Coriander Dhania Leaves Chopped Cup Mint Leaves Pudina Chopped

To cook basmati rice separately, wash and soak the basmati rice in water for 20 minutes.Meanwhile add about 3 litres of water in a large vessel and bring it to boil.Once water starts to boil, add about 1 teaspoon of cooking oil and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the soaked and drained rice, stir gently once and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes (I usually take it off heat by 3-1/2 minutes).Keep an eye on rice as some brands of basmati rice cooks very fast and some takes time. My rice was cooked in 5 minutes. Drain the water immediately and spread the rice on a large plate.In a deep bottomed pan, heat oil on medium flame,  add 1 sliced onion and fry it until brown (don’t burn the onions). Remove browned onion from oil and keep it aside. This will be used for garnishing and to make the layers.The next step is to marinate the chicken for the Chicken Dum Biryani Recipe.Clean and wash the chicken thoroughly.In a mixing bowl, marinate the chicken with thick curd, red chili powder, turmeric powder and salt.Marinate for at least 30 minutes. In a large pan, add oil and heat on medium flame, add the remaining sliced onions and saute for 3 minutes or until the onions turn translucent. Next add ginger-garlic paste and saute till the raw smell goes off.Add slit green chilies and mix for a minute.To this add chopped tomatoes and saute till tomatoes turn slightly mushy.Once the tomatoes are mushy add red chili powder, coriander powder and salt and saute it for about 2 minutes.Add 3 tablespoons of both coriander and mint leaves and mix.Finally, add  the marinated chicken for the biryani and mix well. Cook until chicken is fully cooked. Once chicken is cooked, if you find there is excess water, increase the flame and thicken the masala. We need the masala just to coat the chicken.Take a large wide, deep vessel, add ghee and spread it to coat all the bottom and sides of the pan, reduce the flame to low. Add about 2 full tablespoons of the thick chicken biryani masala and spread it all over the bottom.Next, add cooked basmati rice over the chicken biryani masala and gently spread the rice to cover the chicken. Use a tea spoon and remove the top oily layer from masala and drizzle over the rice, this will add flavours to the rice and also give colour.Repeat the layering process until you have used up all rice and chicken. Over the top sprinkle coriander and mint leaves and browned onions and close with a lid.Ensure the flame is low and place a heavy weight on top of lid to trap the steam inside to cook the Chicken Dum Biryani recipe. Leave the dum biryani aside for 10 minutes until all the flavors seep through.Scoop out the Chicken Dum Biryani from the edges of the pan, making sure not to break the rice grains.Serve Chicken Dum Biryani Recipe with Pickled onions, Burani Raita and Mirchi Ka Salan Recipe (Chillies in Tangy Spicy Peanut Sesame Curry) for Sunday afternoon lunch.
